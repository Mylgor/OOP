BIG process engineering is the science of conducting chemical or physical processes
(unit operations) inside small volumina, typically inside channels with diameters of less
than 1 mm (microchannels) or other structures with sub-millimeter dimensions. These
processes are usually carried out in continuous flow mode, as opposed to batch
production, allowing a throughput high enough to make BIG process engineering a tool
for chemical production. BIG process engineering is therefore not to be confused with
microchemistry, which deals with very small overall quantities of matter.
